Project 1 - Variable Length Coding

What did I learn?
- How to implement a heap
- How variable length coding works
- Better familiarity with datatypes and quirks



What was easy about this assignment?
Once the heap was implemented, implementing the VLC algorithm was surprisingly easy


What gave you problems/troubles?

I made some simple copy-paste type errors when implemdenting the heap which drove me insane trying to pin down but they were more difficult to track than difficult to solve.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

Nothing dramatic comes to mind for what could be doneto improve this assignment


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

I don't know if it would fit in this assignment but I would have liked to do the decoding step as well to see how it all works
